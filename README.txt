Hello! Welcome to MultiEditR! We hope that our program can be of use for your edit detection and quantification needs. Please note that this is a beta version of the application, and as such aspects of it are still under development.

However, if you are noticing any errors when using the application please feel free to reach out Mitch at klues009@umn.edu for troubleshooting and input on the application.
